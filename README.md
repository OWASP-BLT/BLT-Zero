# BLT-Zero

**Zero-Trust Vulnerability Reporting — encrypted payload delivery.**

BLT-Zero is a Cloudflare Workers site that lets security researchers submit sensitive vulnerability reports and screenshots **encrypted directly in the browser**. The Worker receives a pre-encrypted payload, forwards it directly to the organization’s security inbox, and stores only minimal metadata.

It is an independent application under the OWASP BLT project family, intended to run on its own deployment and database.

## 🔐 What is BLT-Zero?

BLT-Zero provides a secure workflow for delivering vulnerability reports:

- **Encryption happens client-side (browser)** using modern AES-256 ZIP encryption.
- **BLT-Zero never stores plaintext** vulnerability details.
- **Organizations decrypt locally** using standard archive tools.

### Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Encrypted Transit** | Worker receives only an encrypted ZIP package in Base64 (no plaintext files). |
| **Direct Delivery** | Reports are emailed directly to the organization's security team. |
| **No tracking by design** | No analytics/cookies/fingerprinting in this project. |
| **Abuse controls** | Rate limiting + optional Cloudflare Turnstile. |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components

- **Client (Browser)**
  - Gathers the form data (Target URL, Description, Markdown) and dynamically builds a `report.json` in memory.
  - Bundles the JSON and uploaded screenshots using `@zip.js/zip.js`.
  - Generates a strong, random 24-character password and encrypts the ZIP file (AES-256) entirely inside the browser.
  - Sends the Base64-encoded encrypted ZIP and the generated password to the Worker.

- **Worker (Python / FastAPI)**
  - Validates request + (optional) Turnstile.
  - Emails the encrypted ZIP attachment and the decryption password to the org inbox via SendGrid.

## 🔒 Cryptography & Decryption

**Client-Side Encryption**
To ensure maximum compatibility and avoid requiring organizations to pre-generate PGP/JWK keys, encryption is handled via **AES-256 Password-Protected ZIPs**. The browser generates a secure, ephemeral password, encrypts the payload, and the Worker forwards this password to the organization alongside the file. 

**Decryption (Important Note for Windows Users)**
Because the browser uses modern AES-256 encryption, **the default Windows File Explorer cannot extract the ZIP file** (it will throw Error `0x80004005`). 

To decrypt the report, organizations must use a modern archive utility:
- **Windows:** Use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or WinRAR. Right-click -> Extract Here -> Enter the password from the email.
- **macOS:** Use The Unarchiver or the built-in Archive Utility.
- **Linux:** Use the `unzip` command-line tool.

## ✅ Features

- 🔒 Client-side ZIP encryption in the browser (`@zip.js`).
- 📧 Direct email delivery to org security inbox via SendGrid.
- 🧾 Minimal storage: domain + optional username + artifact hash only.
- 🛡️ Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- 🧩 Optional Turnstile (Can be disabled for local dev using `DISABLE_TURNSTILE=true`).
- 📊 Optional points sync to main BLT.

## 🚀 Workflow (end-to-end)

1. Reporter fills out the vulnerability form and attaches screenshots.
2. Browser intercepts the submission, generates a password, and bundles everything into an AES-256 encrypted ZIP.
3. Worker receives the encrypted Base64 string and the password.
4. Worker emails the ciphertext ZIP attachment + password to the org inbox.
5. Org receives the email, downloads the ZIP, and decrypts it locally using 7-Zip.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWASP-BLT/BLT-Zero.git
cd BLT-Zero
```

2. Install Wrangler (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

3. Login to Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

4. Create `.dev.vars` file from `.dev.vars.example` and populate wrangler.toml with Database ID from previous step:

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
wrangler dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### Org Onboarding (Keys)

1. Generate organization keypair locally:
```bash
python tools/org_keygen.py
```

This will generate:

- `private_key.jwk` (keep this secret)
- `public_key.jwk` (share this with BLT-Zero)

2. Decrypt a received vulnerability report:
```bash
python tools/org_decrypt.py private_key.jwk package.json
```
